        <p class="paragraph">
          My name is Altafur Rahman, and I am an aspiring web developer. My interest in technology and programming had developed when I was able to see the capabilities of what I was able to do by coming up with an idea and taking it to become a finished prototype. As an avid gamer, I came up with an idea that I thought would make it easier for gamers, such as myself, to find games on sale, so I ventured on the journey to create a website based on this idea. After researching online, I found that the best way to make this website was using WordPress simply because it would allow me to create the full website without having to worry about the front end, back end, and server side. So after more research and tutorials, I was able to create the core website through WordPress, use custom themes and plug-ins for the design, features, and user interface of the website, and use custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to modify certain features and functionality of the website. This experience of creating a website really spurred my drive to learn programming and web development as well as entrepreneurship and being able bring my ideas to life.

        <p class="paragraph">
          As a result, software development is one of my biggest passions because I see it as a tool that allows me to use my creativity and create things; I feel software development empowers me to be able to bring my ideas to life so that I can create something unique. Furthermore, I am a person that loves thinking intuitively, and when I first started learning how to code, I instantly fell in love with the logical thinking and problem solving. Throughout the years I have been coming up with many technology-related ideas that have an impact on society, and I have been eager to use programming as the tool and canvas to paint these ideas into reality. Therefore, my hunger to gain the software development skills to work on these ideas is what drives me to look for opportunities. This led me to learn programming by myself no matter how overwhelming the information available online was. I believe my ability in committing to a goal and working through all the steps necessary in order to achieve this goal, while persevering through difficult and stressful situations is one of my strongest qualities, and I hope to bring this quality and passion to my career as a software developer.
